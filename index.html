	<h2>About the Mapathon...</h2>

	<p>
		Welcome to our 4th annual humanitarian mapathon with USC and UCLA. We are so excited to share that this year we
		have expanded our mapathon to a full 3 day event.
	</p>
	<p>
		We will kick things off on Wednesday, October 28th with a special welcome and training. Mappers will then have
		till Thursday night at midnight to be a part of our humanitarian mapathon.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to contributing to humanitarian projects around the world participants are welcome to join us for a
		series of workshops on Thursday October 29th.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, we will bring the event to a close with a special keynote speaker, Ben Welsh from the Los Angeles
		Times, on Friday at 10am. And, of course, we will share the results of our humanitarian mapathon, including top
		mappers as well as our total contribution.
